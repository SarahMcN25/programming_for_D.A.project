## **Conclusion**
This project gave me an insight into how the EU approached the coronavirus pandemic and how the variables affected each of the EU member states. Next year, I would like to compare the current results from December 2021 with the results in December 2022. This would indicate if my findings in this notebook regarding the link between the variables were in fact accurate.
